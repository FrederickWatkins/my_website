<h1>Welcome!</h1>
<p>
	This is my website. It's currently a WIP but in the future I hope that it will hold my projects,
	and maybe a blog about what I do. I'm not a professional webdev, so expect some rought edges.
</p>
<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
	My name is Frederick Watkins, but I go by Freddie. I'm currently an electronics and software
	engineer intern, and next year I'll be studying Engineering at the University of Cambridge. I have
	an interest in all things electronics and software, and I always aim to be as well rounded an
	engineer as possible.

<h2>About This Website</h2>
<p>
	This website is a learning experience, an advertisement, a blog, and a CV all in one! It's built
	on Sveltekit, and the code is available on github
	<a href="https://github.com/FrederickWatkins/my_website">here</a>. Any feedback or issues are
	appreciated.
